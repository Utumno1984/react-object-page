/**
 * Gives the focus back to the element that had it before an overlay opened, however the overlay
 * was opened (Radix trigger, keyboard shortcut, a button elsewhere: `open` is all it looks at).
 *
 * - The element is remembered by listening to `focusin` on the document **only while `open` is
 *   false**, and confirmed against `document.activeElement` at the moment `open` turns true (a focus
 *   lost to `body` in between is not mistaken for the last focused element). The listener is
 *   attached in a layout effect and detached when `open` turns true,
 *   before the children of the newly opened overlay can focus anything, so an `autoFocus` field
 *   inside the content (children's effects run before the parent's) never overwrites it.
 * - On `open: true -> false` the focus returns in the next animation frame, i.e. after the content
 *   has unmounted. Closing and reopening within that frame cancels the return.
 *
 * Declared limits:
 * - If the remembered element was unmounted or is `disabled` at close time, the focus goes to
 *   `fallbackRef` (same checks); without a usable fallback nothing is focused and nothing throws.
 *   The focus is never moved to an arbitrary node.
 * - If nothing but `body` had the focus before opening, there is nothing to return to (fallback,
 *   else left as is). An overlay mounted already open has no remembered element either.
 * - The focus is returned even if the user moved it elsewhere in the meantime (as Radix does).
 * - The content must be unmounted by the next frame after `open` becomes false; an exit animation
 *   that keeps it mounted longer must delay `open` accordingly.
 * - Closing and reopening before that frame fires does not forget the real opener: while a return
 *   is still pending, the listener's cleanup (which runs on the same reopen) does not overwrite
 *   `openerRef` with `document.activeElement` (transiently `body` right after the content
 *   unmounts, not a genuine new focus target) — see `pendingReturnRef` below.
 * - Only the main document is observed: an opener inside an iframe or in an encapsulated DOM tree
 *   (web component) is not supported (the document never sees the inner element as the `focusin`
 *   target).
 *
 * Wrappers use this instead of Radix's own `onCloseAutoFocus` (call `preventDefault()` there).
